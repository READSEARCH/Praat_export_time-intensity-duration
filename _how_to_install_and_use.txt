Download all files in from this directory and save them on your computer.

for MAC: create a folder called 'plugin_Sound_Data' in this location: USER_FOLDER/Library/Preferences/Praat Prefs/ and put the files in there.
The folder library can be invisible. If that is the case, open the menu 'Go' and press the alt-key. Then it appears.

for WINDOWS: create a folder called 'plugin_Sound_Data' in this location: C:\Users\USER_FOLDER\Praat\ and put the files in there.

for Linux: create a folder called 'plugin_Sound_Data' in this location: HOMEDIRECTORY/.praat-dir/ and put the files in there.

All Praat info about Praat plugins can be found at http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/plug-ins.html.


After the restart of Praat, new menu items will be added to 'Goodies' and 'Preferences.' On Mac, these are hidden away behind the menu 'Praat.'
The pitch contours can be changed in the code, currently there is not yet an user interface for that.
